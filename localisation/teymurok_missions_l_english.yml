  tey_big_fridge_desc: "We already have body storage, but with the ever increasing demand for zombies, it's no longer enough. It also doesn't have enough space to sort zombies for easy future use.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need builders with a rare set of skills. First, they must have a lot of experience in mining and building large underground utilities to create a huge network of underground caves in the mountains of the Northern Citadel. Second, they must be experts in frost magic to create the conditions necessary for long-term storage of bodies.\n\nFortunately, we have those who combine both of these qualities. The Dwarves are renowned masters of creating underground cities, and it would be logical to seek their help. And there are no dwarves better known for their work with frost magic than the people of Krakdhumvurr."

The Church.\n\nIt's one of their responsibilities to see the darkness in people's hearts and guide them to the right path. But there are no people who are never wrong, and this is the one case where the church got it wrong. \n\nWe don't want to hurt anyone. We just want what is best for those around us: to free them from the hard labor and risk of being killed in battle by putting that burden on the shoulders of zombies.\n\nWe just need to find those church members who can listen to us and realize how much better the world will be if they stop preaching hatred against us. And the money they get from us will just be a small reminder that we are better friends."
  tey_zombie_factory_prep_title: "Factory preparation"
  tey_zombie_factory_prep_desc: "Necromancers don't have to have a fixed location in which they work: that way you can search for bodies in different places and pick them up at once. But when a whole state supplies you with bodies, you can concentrate only on working with them.\n\nSometimes you need to fuse muscles or bones. Sometimes you need to improve your appearance by fixing skin. And it would be more convenient to do it in a special place. Since Jarken is a court mage and needs to be present at court sometimes, it is more convenient if his factory is not too far from the capital. But it's better not to put it too close to the city. People are willing to use anything as long as they don't know how it was made. Let them remain in ignorance."
  tey_small_fridge_title: "Temporary storage"
  tey_small_fridge_desc: "Until now, we didn't have a special place for the bodies. We had to store them wherever and however we could. Often the bodies decayed before Yarken could even look at them, to the point where it was easier to throw them away than to try to make zombies out of them.\n\nWe need to create a special storage facility for the bodies, so we can make sure there is no spoilage of scarce material. For that, we need experts in frost magic. And while the Magisterium clearly doesn't like what we're doing here, they don't have the power to prevent all mages from working with us. Some money will help them turn a blind eye and work with us even despite the ban from the Magisterium."

In order not to give rise to foul insinuations, we will condemn the Sorcerer King's atrocities with threefold effort."

  tey_desperate_times_title: "Desperate times"
  tey_desperate_times_desc: "Popular uprisings and wars with disgruntled neighbors had exhausted our army. Opponents of our reforms thought that if they exhausted us, we would be forced to abandon our plans to use zombies. They didn't realize that they were only causing us to rely on zombies even more. Due to the shortage of people to serve, we will be forced to send the available zombies to the army to keep ourselves safe from enemy attacks.\n\nWe foresee demoralization of the army: not everyone will be happy to stand in line with a dead man. But the more people interact with things they don't like, the quicker they'll get used to it."
  tey_not_war_only_title: "Not war only"
  tey_not_war_only_desc: "We've only ever collected the bodies of enemies defeated in battle to avoid unnerving the population, but I think it's time for a change. People have gotten used to zombies enough that maybe they won't be so unhappy when we offer them to sell their bodies to the government.\n\nThere will be two kinds of contracts. The first, instant: for those who have had a relative die recently and they want to dispose of the body. This will require proof of kinship and that the death was not willful in order to sell the body. And the second, postponed: for those who want to sell their body to the state after death and receive some financial support for the rest of their lives. But in that case, some restrictions would be placed on the signer so that he or she could not leave the country or deface the body too much.\n\nSure, some will be disgruntled, but that's the kind of disgruntlement that must be endured. Economic incentives are some of the most effective ways to influence people. Adding ways to interact with zombies to the economy will make people look at them differently in general - and that's another step towards normalizing zombies in our state."

  tey_by_their_deeds_desc: "What is the reformer's greatest enemy? Popular uprisings? Conspiracies of the elite? Foreign interventions? Diplomatic and economic blockade? In fact, these are just different manifestations of the same problem that torments us again and again. Backwardness. Once people noticed we were using zombies, we were labeled as complete villains. They haven't heard stories of law-abiding necromancers and are therefore incapable of even imagining them. No amount of exhortation could change their minds. To any argument we made, they said that we were just trying to distract them from our misdeeds. So we gave up trying to explain anything to them and handed the task over to the best storyteller - time. Only time could show our critics that we were not committing one atrocity after another and persuade them to reconsider their attitude towards us."

  tey_doctrine_of_duality_title: "Docttrine of duality"
  tey_doctrine_of_duality_desc: "Our first attempt to buy bodies from the public was not very successful. We were able to buy a certain number of bodies, but it was so insignificant that some might have thought the campaign was a complete failure. Some, but not us. After analyzing this campaign, we came to the conclusion that there were two problems.\n\nFirst, the proposal was too revolutionary at the time, and people would not even listen to the suggestion to sell the body, and those who did listen doubted whether a pious person could do such an act, since it would disturb his posthumous rest and he would not be able to enter heaven. Enough time has passed, and we can say that now people are more relaxed about our proposal and do not run away at once. But it would be almost impossible for us to convince them ourselves, because the state is not an authority for people in matters of faith. Fortunately, we don't have to do it ourselves. The church is who people trust in this matter. If the church starts spreading the doctrine we came up with about the duality of body and spirit, it will be easier for people to agree to sell the body.\n\nSecondly, the infrastructure was not prepared, there were no dedicated places and personnel to evaluate potential candidates and sign contracts. Also, there were no special agents to check whether the signatories complied with the terms of the contract and to return those who would try to escape."

Any controversy indicates a lack of consensus. Our attempts to prove to the world that we are not the villains only added fuel to the fire of controversy: “Can they be trusted?”. By trying to prove to someone that we are just like everyone else, we only showed how we stand out. By our actions, we were only fueling the fading controversy. After realizing that we were only making things worse, we shifted our focus to what we could change. We continued to use zombies to improve human welfare. And it worked. We have shown by deed that we are no worse, and in many ways even better than anyone else.\n\nThere are some things you don't have to prove. And we don't need to prove to anyone that we're not villains."

  tey_blockade_is_loosening_desc: "When we first announced the use of zombies, all of our neighbors and beyond were unanimous in their desire to “keep the contagion from getting stronger and spreading”. But as time passed, some noticed that the threat we posed was no greater than that of other nations, and there was no need to single us out. Others hated us fervently, but could not do anything tangible about it. Others simply did not want to quarrel with their neighbor. There were those who realized that if they did not support the blockade, they could profit from the reluctance of others to do business with us.\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing is clear: the blockade failed. It would be foolish to say that it has gone unnoticed, but it would also be foolish to say that it has weakened us to the point where our regime is only months away."

Thinking about how to solve this problem, we came up with a rather simple solution. What if we don't solve the problem at all? What if you make others solve your problem? So we came up with the idea of trying to negotiate with other governments to collect bodies from other countries and then sell them to us. There's no such thing as too much money: finding someone who will do it shouldn't be a problem. How exactly they find the bodies is of no interest to us."

To make an army out of a crowd of zombies, we need officers who are trained to control zombies and know how to manage them on the battlefield. But we have nowhere to get such officers, which means we have to train them ourselves."

By comparing something seemingly new with something that has already been analyzed from all sides, one can notice some similarities and use them to simplify decision-making.\n\nOur enemies, in order to show everyone who is a hero and who is a villain, started comparing us to Black Castanor from the time of the Sorcerer King, because then it would be obvious to anyone that they are playing the role of the League of Free Realms. By presenting themselves as fighters against evil, they hoped to attract additional allies to their cause. In general, their idea was not too successful, because our image has already sunk to such a low point that the only way was up. They also failed to hide the unpleasant fact that we were not the aggressors.\n\nThey could not find help immediately, but their appeal to history did not go unnoticed. More and more often our opponents are talking about forming a defensive alliance to prevent the spread of necromancy beyond Teymurok."

Their status obliged them to see us as a potential threat, which made it only harder for them to admit that they'd been blaming the wrong people all along. This could have gone on forever, were it not for Jarken's own personal connections. Some of his acquaintances, who hold important positions in the Magisterium, were able to promote the idea of inspecting Teymurok to make sure our people weren't scared to death by a mad necromancer."
